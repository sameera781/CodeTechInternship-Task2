Project Overview: Basic Calculator Program
The Basic Calculator Program is a Java application designed to perform simple arithmetic operations. It provides an interactive way for users to calculate results based on their inputs. Below are the key details of the project:

Core Features
User Input

Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Allow users to select an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
Perform Calculations

Execute the selected operation using the provided numbers.
Handle division by zero with appropriate error messages.
Display Results

Output the result of the chosen operation in a clear format.
Allow users to perform additional calculations.
Additional Features
Input Validation: Ensure that only valid numerical inputs are accepted.
Loop for Repeated Use: Let users continue performing calculations until they opt to exit.
Error Handling: Handle invalid operations or edge cases like dividing by zero.
Technical Components
Conditionals: Use if-else or switch-case to determine the selected operation.
Loops: Implement a loop (e.g., while or do-while) for repeated user interactions.
Methods: Modularize code by creating separate methods for each operation.
